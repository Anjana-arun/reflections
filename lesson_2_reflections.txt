This is the second lesson.Now I have created a git repository,Basically I am going to do version control of all the files in this directory.As I have given the init git and not comiited the snapshot of all the files in the directory is not created.At present no files have been tracked.

The working directory is the base area to work on.The status is the intermediate between woking directory and ana ctual commit.And the repository contains the saved version of the commit
