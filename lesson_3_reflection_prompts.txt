Hello! I am creating a new reflectiond file in GITHUb


There might be changes which I have comitted that I do not widh to make publicly availabe yet.In such cases manual pushes and pulls are better than automatic ones

Git fork-copy a project from git hub to your git hub repository.Nothing is stored in local
clone-copy a project from yur github repository to your local.
 Branch-branch out a different version of code from your main branch of code(master)

 The local copies of remote branches can be automatically updated using pull command which is a fetch and merge.This is quite easy to implement.Further more, fast forward merge is simpler compared to the usual one.
 when it comes to collaborating with multiple epole github is very easy to implement..but the modifications hould be done after moving the code to your local git
 Merging on a separate local brach is to see the conflicts that might occur , if the code actually functions properly .It can be to show others how it works before the actual commit
